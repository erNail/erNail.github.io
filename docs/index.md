Greetings! My name is Eric Nagel. I'm a seasoned professional in the domains of Site Reliability, DevOps, and Software Engineering.

My expertise spans a wide range of tools, languages, and technologies.
These include Kubernetes, Helm Charts, Gitlab CI/CD, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus,
Grafana, Containerization, Typescript, JavaScript, Node.js, Angular, Java, and Spring Boot.

My philosophy is rooted in the belief that high-quality standards must be maintained throughout the entire DevOps cycle,
achieved through a series of practices. You will find these explained in detail here:
