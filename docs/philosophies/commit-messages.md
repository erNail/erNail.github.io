# Commit Messages

Commit messages are essential in any software development project.
They ensure clarity and traceability by providing a well-documented history of changes in the codebase.

When troubleshooting issues, these commit messages offer a quick
overview of recent modifications that could have contributed to the problem, aiding in the debugging process.

Additionally, consistent and thoughtful commit messages can be beneficial in automating the release process.
