# Release Automation

The tasks associated with software releases, such as determining new version numbers, writing changelogs,
and releasing new packages, can be time-consuming and prone to manual errors.
Automation can significantly increase efficiency and reduce the likelihood of mistakes in this process.

One way to achieve this is by utilizing tools like `semantic-release`. This tool can automatically determine the new
version number from commit messages, generate the changelog likewise, and perform the release.
