# Blameless Post Mortem

In the event of service outages, conducting a blameless post mortem is an essential practice.
Its purpose is to analyze why the outage occurred, in a manner that focuses on learning and prevention,
rather than attributing blame.

The goal is to understand exactly what happened, the contributing factors, and most importantly,
what actions can be taken to prevent similar issues in the future.

Embracing a blameless culture fosters an environment of openness and continuous learning.
It encourages team members to share their experiences and insights,
which can be instrumental in enhancing system resilience and reliability.
