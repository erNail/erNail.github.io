# Code Reviews

Code reviews are a critical part of the software development process.
They provide an opportunity for team members to improve the quality of the code, leveraging different experiences and perspectives.

In a code review, the likelihood of identifying human errors increases. This is due to the diversity of the reviewers'
backgrounds and the additional pairs of eyes inspecting the changes.

Code reviews also foster knowledge sharing among team members. Through these sessions, experiences and opinions are
exchanged, contributing to the collective knowledge of the team.

For code reviews to be efficient, it is beneficial to conduct them in a pair programming format. This approach can
expedite the review process and reduce misunderstandings between the reviewers and the reviewee.
