# Monitoring

Monitoring is crucial once services are deployed and Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitments are in place.
Not only is it important to monitor the services themselves, but also the infrastructure they run on.

Dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the behavior of the services and the underlying infrastructure.
They offer real-time visibility into the performance and status of the system,
enabling swift identification and resolution of issues.

Alerts, coupled with an on-call duty roster, allow for quick reactions to any service outages.
This proactive approach helps in maintaining the uptime and reliability of the services.

Log aggregation is a critical tool for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of the services.
It facilitates the collection, processing, and analysis of log data,
which can be instrumental in troubleshooting and performance optimization.

As part of the "Everything as Code" philosophy, monitoring tools and configurations should also be managed as code.
This approach ensures consistent monitoring settings across environments and aids in maintaining high standards of service
performance and reliability.
