# Testing

Automated testing plays a crucial role in preventing bugs and issues from making their way into a production environment.
As software projects grow and new features are integrated, the likelihood of unexpected behaviors or breaks increases.
Automated tests are designed to identify issues early.
This early detection enables teams to fix problems at the development stage, reducing the risk of production failures.

In the context of the "Everything as Code" philosophy, automated testing becomes even more critical. With everything from
code to configurations being part of the testing process, we can ensure a high level of reliability across all project
components.
