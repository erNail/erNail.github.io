# CI / CD Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines are key to a highly automated DevOps cycle.
They serve as the backbone of efficient and reliable software delivery processes.

Upon each code change, several actions should automatically occur.
The code should be linted and formatted, ensuring it adheres to defined standards and is consistently structured.

Next, automated tests should run, verifying the integrity and functionality of the changes.

Following successful tests, the code should be built, packaged, and appropriately versioned.

Finally, the new version of the application should be automatically released and deployed.
This process ensures every change is rapidly and safely delivered to the production environment.

The "Everything as Code" philosophy greatly enhances the effectiveness of CI/CD pipelines, as it extends the automation
to all aspects of the project.
